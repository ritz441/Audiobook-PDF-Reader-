# Audiobook PDF Reader
This is a basic audiobook pdf reader programmed in python to read out text from any pdf effectively. The user can modify the voice, rate and start reading from any page of any random pdf till the very end. Two libraries -  PyPDF2 and  pyttsx3 (for text to speech conversion) have been used.
